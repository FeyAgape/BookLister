# BookLister
A Book Listing App

The goal is to design and create the structure of a Book Listing app which would allow a user to get a list of published books on a 
given topic. Used the google books api in order to fetch results and display them to the user.

This project is about combining various ideas and skills weâ€™ve been practicing throughout the course. They include:

Fetching data from an API

Using an AsyncTask

Parsing a JSON response

Creating a list based on that data and displaying it to the user.

API Call: The user can enter a word or phrase to serve as a search query. The app fetches book data related to the query via an HTTP request from the Google Books API, using a class such as HttpUriRequest or HttpURLConnection.

Response Validation: The app checks whether the device is connected to the internet and responds appropriately. The result of the request is validated to account for a bad server response or lack of server response.

Async Task: The network call occurs off the UI thread using an AsyncTask or similar threading object.

JSON Parsing: The JSON response is parsed correctly, and relevant information is stored in the app.

ListView Population: The ListView is properly populated with the information parsed from the JSON response.

No Data Message: When there is no data to display, the app shows a default TextView that informs the user how to populate the list.
